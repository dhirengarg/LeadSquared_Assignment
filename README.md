# LeadSquared_Assignment

Objective: 
To get the top relevent customer reviews about the product so that company could get the insights about their products. 

Assumptions:
1. If I could show the top_n and botton_n reviews about the product based on the polarity(sentiment of review) and ratings, this could give insights to customers about their product best and worst features. 

About Notebook:
I started with EDA to get familier with data, then doing some data cleaning techniques followed with creating features using tfidf and countvectorizer. Used few Classification models like . Naivebayes, Randomforest and XGboost. 
Choose Randomforest and predict the most relevent reviews. 

Then I tried LSTM to further improve the F-score. 


Future Enhancements:
1. BERT base models could be implemented 
2. More embedding techniques could be explored to make features. 
3.
